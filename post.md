# Lab 01: Journey into Hardware - Exploring the Basics of Breadboarding and Arduino in the Lab!!

## Overview and Motivation
This lab introduces the hardware environment used in the course, focusing on the PB-503 breadboard prototyping stations and Arduino microcontroller systems. The activities involve exploring the breadboard's features and integrating the Arduino for embedded processor control. You will work with components like LEDs, resistors, and integrated circuit chips, requiring reference to IC data sheets. The lab aims to develop skills in reading data sheets, understanding the components' functions, and, last but not least, experiment with computer hardwares!
