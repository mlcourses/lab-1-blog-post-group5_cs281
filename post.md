# Lab X: Doing stuff with hardware!

Please write a blog post describing your lab here.

This is just an example of how you might structure your blog post, feel free to edit as you wish. For example, you might divide the lab into different sections each with their own intro, instructions, results, and takeaways. Please see the rubric for details on how the post will be evaluated.

## Overview and Motivation
This lab introduces the hardware environment used in the course, focusing on the PB-503 breadboard prototyping stations and Arduino microcontroller systems. The activities involve exploring the breadboard's features and integrating the Arduino for embedded processor control. Students will work with components like LEDs, resistors, and integrated circuit chips, requiring reference to IC data sheets. The lab aims to develop skills in reading data sheets and understanding the components' functions. A peer-reviewed blog post on Github Classroom is required, documenting the lab experience.
